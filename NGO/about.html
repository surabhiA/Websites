<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<img src="images/patient2.jpg" alt="Patient">    

<p>Asha Kiran is a registered, Non Government Organization(NGO).As the name suggests, this a ray of hope for cancer patients, residing in jaipur and also those who come to jaipur for cancer treatment from different parts of Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Asha Kiran particularly caters to the financially weak patients who come for their treatment at S.M.S.Hospital Jaipur (INDIA),a government hospital. In wake of the problems faced by them at the hospital, Asha Kiran initiated counselling and minimum financial help to these patients.</p>
<p>When the Palliative care trained nurses and volunteers visit such patients, they find a variety of difficulties being faced by the family. Either the education of the children is stalled, or they have no money for medicines and treatment,but worst of all,they often do not have enough money to feed the family.To help such cancer patients, members of Asha Kiran try to help them at home with the limited resources of the organization.
</p>
<p>Asha Kiran provides free monthly ration packages, school/college fees for their children, nursing care, medicines and counselling to patients and family members to boost their morale.If a family member of the patient is illiterate, Asha kiran provides them with sewing machines with a fully paid tailoring course  and/or infrastructure for opening a tea shop. This is a small way in which an effort is made to rehabilitate the cancer patient and his family.
</p>

<h3>Why help a child?</h3>
<p>When the earning member of a poor family is affected by cancer,his already limited resources are spent in trying to undergo treatment and provide for his family.In such conditions he cannot afford to continue his children’s basic education.Asha Kiran not only provides for treatment expenses of the patient,but also helps the family with basic necessities like free ration, counselling and supporting his children’s education.</p>
<p><em><b>Asha Kiran provides free education to children of cancer patients</b></em>.In the year 2013-14 itself we have funded the education of 22 such children and provided for their school fees, stationary and uniforms.
    
<h3>How can you help Asha Kiran?</h3>
<p>Asha Kiran can only help limited number of children complete their education with its limited resources.But you can help us increase this current figure of 22.You can <em><b>sponsor one or more such children</b></em> and help them become self-sufficient! </p>
<p>By sponsoring a child,you can either donate an amount for a child’s education and supplies to the organization,or you can also donate the amount to the school directly.</p>
<h4>100 % of your donations will be used to help the needy.
